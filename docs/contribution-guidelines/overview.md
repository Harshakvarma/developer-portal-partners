# Overview

## What is Siemens Xcelerator Developer Portal

It is the [developer portal](https://developer.siemens.com) for Siemens' customers and partners.

The Developer Portal is integrated with [Siemens Xcelerator Marketplace](https://xcelerator.siemens.com) and [discussion forum](https://community.siemens.com).

The developer portal offers following features:

## Documentation as Code

**Documentation as code (DaC)** is a methodology that treats documentation as source code, using the same tools and processes. It has several advantages, including improved accuracy and consistency, improved collaboration, and improved discoverability.

The portal is the home for developer documentation, offering a common place for resources to guide through our products, features, and capabilities.

## API Catalogue

Within the Siemens Xcelerator Ecosystem we are building an **API catalogue** for Siemens. We want to:

**Improve discoverability and reuse of APIs.** An API catalogue can make it easier for developers to find and use the APIs they need, which can help to improve efficiency and reduce development costs.

**Increase API governance.** An API catalogue can help to centralize and manage API usage, which can help to improve security and compliance.

**Support API-driven innovation.** An API catalogue can help to promote API-driven innovation by making it easier for developers to build new applications and services that use APIs.

**Improve developer experience.** API catalogue can help to improve the developer experience by providing a central location for developers to find documentation, code samples, and other resources related to APIs.

## Developer Resources

The developer portal provides developers with the resources they need to build applications and services that integrate with an enterprise's products and services. These resources can include SDKs, guidelines, design systems, and playgrounds.

* [**SDKs, or software development kits**](https://developer.siemens.com/resources/sdks/index.html) are sets of tools and libraries that developers can use to build applications that interact with an enterprise's products and services. SDKs can provide developers with access to APIs, data, and other resources that they need to build their applications.

* [**Guidelines**](https://developer.siemens.com/guidelines/index.html) are documents that provide developers with best practices and recommendations for building applications that meet the enterprise's standards. Guidelines can cover topics such as design, security, and performance.

* [**Design systems**](https://developer.siemens.com/resources/design-systems/overview.html) are collections of reusable components, styles, and assets that developers can use to build consistent and beautiful applications. Design systems can help developers save time and effort, and they can also help to ensure that applications are consistent with the enterprise's brand.

* [**Playgrounds**](https://developer.siemens.com/resources/playgrounds/index.html) are interactive environments where developers can experiment with APIs, data, and other resources. Playgrounds can be a great way for developers to learn about an enterprise's products and services, and they can also be a great way for developers to test and debug their code.
